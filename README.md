## üñºÔ∏è ReVanced logo

### üö© The basics

The ReVanced logo is the most recognizable asset, which is why it is important to follow certain rules when used:

- Do not alter, rotate, or modify the logo. Exceptions apply below
- Do not animate the logo
- Use the latest revision of the logo available at all time

### üé® Colors

The ReVanced logo has a triadic gradient that defines its character. The ring as well as the logo feature a top-to-bottom gradient blending the colors <img height="16px" src="https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/47723802/243146503-fbc21584-94a5-436b-9277-3c64a72baf97.png"/> `#F04E98`, <img height="16px" src="https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/47723802/243146541-fcb07e8d-9ba4-4292-b633-f64a01b80341.png"/> `#5F65D4`, and <img height="16px" src="https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/47723802/243146582-18441902-b968-434c-bc40-f78bf975e86c.png"/> `#4E98F0` on the background color <img height="16px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a270dcbb-c720-4bca-8c11-d39328a85e4a"/> `#1B1B1B`.

The ReVanced logo should appear in single shades of black and white, but the diamond may appear in any color. A light shade and vice versa should be used on a dark background.

### üìè Spacing

The ReVanced logo should have a minimum margin of 15% of its original size. If a headline accompanies the logo, the margin of the logo and headline should be increased together.

### ‚òùÔ∏è Headline

The ReVanced logo should be accompanied by a headline of any typeface, preferably [Manrope](assets/revanced-typeface/manrope), starting with the [wordmark](assets/revanced-wordmark) on the right or below the logo only.

The headline should appear in single shades of black and white. A light shade and vice versa should be used on a dark background. The full ReVanced logo should be used with a headline.

### üåê Socials

Any border-radius may be used for the ReVanced logo.

### ‚ùå Misuse

- Don't add special effects
- Don't change orientation
- Don't add drop shadows
- Don't add additional elements
- Don't add patterns or textures
- Don't skew, rotate, or stretch
- Don't change color
- Don't accompany the logo with a headline starting with anything other than the wordmark
- Don't overemphasize the logo

## üî§ ReVanced marks

- Anything that includes ReVanced in the name

> [!IMPORTANT]
> No letter except R and V in "ReVanced" should be capitalized.
